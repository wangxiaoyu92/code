Description:

Parameter 1 of method getShiroFilterFactoryBean in net.sppan.base.config.shiro.ShiroConfig required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- myRealm: defined in file [C:\zka\springboot_authority-master\target\classes\net\sppan\base\config\shiro\MyRealm.class]
	- shiroDbRealm: defined by method 'shiroDbRealm' in class path resource [net/sppan/base/config/shiro/ShiroConfig.class]


Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed

Description:

Parameter 1 of method getShiroFilterFactoryBean in net.sppan.base.config.shiro.ShiroConfig required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- myRealm: defined in file [C:\zka\springboot_authority-master\target\classes\net\sppan\base\config\shiro\MyRealm.class]
	- shiroDbRealm: defined by method 'shiroDbRealm' in class path resource [net/sppan/base/config/shiro/ShiroConfig.class]


Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed

Description:

Parameter 1 of method getShiroFilterFactoryBean in net.sppan.base.config.shiro.ShiroConfig required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- myRealm: defined in file [C:\zka\springboot_authority-master\target\classes\net\sppan\base\config\shiro\MyRealm.class]
	- shiroDbRealm: defined by method 'shiroDbRealm' in class path resource [net/sppan/base/config/shiro/ShiroConfig.class]


Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed
